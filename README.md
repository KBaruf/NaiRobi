# Comfy-Sloth Ecommerce

[ComfySloth](https://comfysloth.vercel.app/) is a web application for selling custom-made furniture.

Build with a bunch of technologies, but to name a few:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) 
- [Stripe Gateway](https://stripe.com/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
- [NextAuth](https://next-auth.js.org/)
- [Styled-jsx](https://nextjs.org/blog/styling-next-with-styled-jsx)

## Set Up

## Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

## Using CSS
To enable high reusability and clean CSS files, the styled component was utilized.
```jsx
const Wrapper = styled.article`
  .subtotal {
    display: none;
  }
  .price {
    display: none;
  }
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 200px auto auto;
  grid-template-rows: 75px;
  gap: 3rem 1rem;
  justify-items: center;
  margin-bottom: 3rem;
  align-items: center;
  }
```
